```{r standard_reprocessing}
# Standard Preprocessing of Seurat Objects
# This script performs essential preprocessing steps on each Seurat object in the seuratObjList.
# It includes quality control, gene filtering, and calculation of various metadata.
# Detailed explanation of the preprocessing steps:
# 1. Gene Filtering:
#    - Removes specific genes ('Gm42418' and 'AY036118') that are known to represent rRNA contamination.
#    - These genes overlap with the rRNA element Rn45s and are excluded to improve data quality.
#
# 2. Mitochondrial Gene Percentage:
#    - Calculates the percentage of mitochondrial genes for each cell.
#    - Adds this information as a new metadata column 'percent.mt'.
#    - Filters out cells with high mitochondrial content (>10%), which often indicates low-quality or dying cells.
#
# 3. Ribosomal Protein Gene Percentages:
#    - Calculates the percentage of ribosomal protein S (RPS) genes and adds it as 'percent.rps'.
#    - Calculates the percentage of ribosomal protein L (RPL) genes and adds it as 'percent.rpl'.
#    - These metrics can be useful for assessing cell quality and state.
#
# 4. Quality Control Visualisation:
#    - Prints summary statistics for each processed Seurat object, allowing for quick assessment of the dataset.
#
# Note: The script is prepared for potential SCTransform normalisation (currently commented out),
# which can be used for advanced normalisation and variance stabilisation if needed.

# This preprocessing ensures that each Seurat object in seuratObjList is cleaned, 
# filtered, and annotated with important quality metrics, preparing the data for 
# downstream analysis such as clustering, differential expression, and trajectory inference.

```{r merge}
### This script merges multiple Seurat objects into a single object and performs essential preprocessing steps.
# It includes merging datasets, normalisation using SCTransform, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
# 1. Merge Datasets:
#    - Combines multiple Seurat objects from the seuratObjList into a single Seurat object.
#    - This is necessary to create a unified dataset for consistent preprocessing and analysis.
#
# 2. Normalisation with SCTransform:
#    - Applies SCTransform to the merged dataset for normalisation and variance stabilization.
#    - The 'vst.flavor' parameter is set to "v2" for improved performance and accuracy.
#    - SCTransform uses the glmGamPoi method to model the gene expression counts.
#
# 3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
#    - Runs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the normalised data to reduce its dimensionality.
#    - PCA captures the most significant sources of variation in the data.
#
# 4. Elbow Plot Visualisation:
#    - Generates an elbow plot to help determine the optimal number of principal components to use in downstream analysis.
#
# This preprocessing ensures that the merged Seurat object is normalised, dimensionally reduced, and ready for further analysis such as clustering and integration.

```{r integrate}
# This script performs integration on the merged single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.
# It offers two integration methods based on the 'use_amdsg' condition:
# 1. AMDSG gene list-based integration
# 2. Standard (full dataset) integration
#
# - The 'use_amdsg' variable determines which integration method to use.
# - AMDSG Integration (if use_amdsg is TRUE):
#   * Focuses on a specific set of genes (AMDSG gene list).
#   * Useful for targeted analysis of certain biological processes or pathways.
#   * May provide more focused results but could miss broader cellular differences.
# - Standard Integration (if use_amdsg is FALSE):
#   * Uses the entire dataset for integration.
#   * Provides a comprehensive view of cellular heterogeneity across all genes.
#   * Captures broader patterns but may be less sensitive to specific gene sets.
#
# Both integration methods:
# 1. Use Harmony for batch correction and data integration.
# 2. Perform clustering to identify cell populations.
# 3. Apply dimensionality reduction for visualization (t-SNE for AMDSG, UMAP for standard).
# 4. Generate visualizations to explore the integrated data.
#
# The choice between AMDSG and standard integration depends on the research question:
# - Use AMDSG for focused analysis on specific genes or pathways of interest.
# - Use standard integration for unbiased, comprehensive analysis of cellular heterogeneity.
#
# After running this script, 'seurat_integrated' will contain the integrated dataset,
# ready for further analysis such as differential expression or trajectory inference.

#  Load and execute the appropriate integration script based on the condition
if (use_amdsg) {
  # Load AMDSG integration
  source("G:/My Drive/Genres2024/Integrated_prepare/04_AMDSG_integration.R")

```{r trajectory and pseudotime}
# -This line sources (loads and executes) an R script named "07_trajectories.R" located in the specified directory.
# - The script performs trajectory analysis using Slingshot to infer cellular trajectories and order cells along pseudotime.
# - It starts by loading the preprocessed merged Seurat object and converting it to a SingleCellExperiment object.
# - Slingshot is then used to infer trajectories based on PCA-reduced dimensions and cluster labels.
# - Pseudotime values are calculated and added to the Seurat object as metadata.
# - The script visualises the inferred trajectories and creates a heatmap to show gene expression changes along pseudotime.
# - The heatmap is saved as a PNG file for further analysis and interpretation.
